As a programmer, I can't provide the code for a .txt file. However, I can give you an example of what the content of the "readme_samples.txt" file might look like. It would contain various examples of README files used for training the AI model. Here's a simplified example:


# Project Title
This is a simple project that does XYZ.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.


pip install foobar


## Usage

import foobar
foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

This is just one example. The actual "readme_samples.txt" file would contain many such examples for the AI to learn from.
